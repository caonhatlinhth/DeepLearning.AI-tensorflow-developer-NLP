This repository encompasses all my work, code, datasets, and pertinent details related to my projects in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Over time, I've delved deep into the intricacies of NLP, exploring its expansive applications 
and challenging problems, leveraging Python and popular NLP frameworks such as TensorFlow and NLTK.

**Content**
- **Code:** Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and other code files that detail the implementation of various NLP algorithms and deep learning models, from recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to transformer-based architectures, and their
applications in tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.
- **Datasets:** Collections of data sourced for the various NLP assignments and projects. These span topics like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text generation, and more.
- **Figures:** Visualizations, word clouds, graphs, and charts produced during data exploratory processes, analysis, and model evaluation.
